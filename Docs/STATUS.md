# Episode Ranker — Current Status

**Read this file first** — before the other docs, before doing anything else. It's the single
"what's actually going on right now" pointer, kept short and current on purpose.

Last updated: 2026-07-15 (later same day). **Clean deliberate stop, mid-Phase-0, for session
budget.** An implementer agent finished the ranking-algorithm prototype + website scaffold (42/42
tests passing); nothing is committed to `main` or merged yet — it's sitting in a worktree pending
the independent-review pass this correctness-critical work requires (see `ProcessAndRoles.md`). No
agent is currently running. Next session: start with the review (Bucket 1 below), then proceed to
the rest of Phase 0.

## Punch List (ranked — read this section first for "what's actually next")

Every open item gets triaged into exactly one bucket the moment it surfaces, per
[ProcessAndRoles.md](ProcessAndRoles.md#punch-list-triage). Default is "log it, don't chase it"
unless it's small or genuinely blocking.

**Bucket 1 — Blocking / next in sequence:**
1. **Review and merge the Phase 0 algorithm/scaffold work.** An implementer agent built the
   ranking-algorithm module (`website/src/lib/ranking/`) and a minimal Next.js scaffold — 42/42 tests
   pass, typecheck/lint/build all clean. Sitting uncommitted in worktree
   `.claude\worktrees\agent-a5d288589bf0cb0ed` (branch `worktree-agent-a5d288589bf0cb0ed`, already
   fast-forwarded onto `main` at `cfe900d`). Needs the independent-reviewer pass before merge (see
   `ProcessAndRoles.md`) — not yet done, paused for session budget. See Deviations below for the 7
   judgment calls the implementer made, one of which (#7, cold-start→comparative migration) actually
   pre-empts an open `AppSpec.md` question and needs your input, not just a code review.
2. Once merged: stand up the Supabase project (Auth + schema) and prove the TMDB proxy +
   Next.js/Vercel deploy path — the rest of `DevelopmentPlan.md` Phase 0.

**Bucket 2 — Bugs/features needing hands-on verification or fixing:**
(empty for now)

**Bucket 3 — Design decisions needing human input (don't block code):**
1. Tie-break common-episode selection mechanics — which episode to pick when several candidates
   exist, what to do when none exist yet. See `DevelopmentPlan.md`'s Ranking Algorithm section.

**Bucket 4 — Backlog, logged, not being chased:**
1. Shared test-fixture format to keep the TypeScript (website) and Swift (iOS) ranking-algorithm
   implementations from drifting apart — relevant once the iOS phase (Phase 4) starts porting the
   algorithm, not before. See `DevelopmentPlan.md` Discussion.

**Bucket 5 — Rework flagged for a later phase, not being worked now:**
(empty for now)

## Deviations Awaiting Review

Solo judgment calls made mid-session that weren't slept on get logged here and surfaced at the
start of the next session for a second look — even solo, "I decided this at 11pm without thinking
it through" is worth a deliberate re-check, not silent acceptance.

- 2026-07-15: Implementer agent made 7 judgment calls while building the ranking-algorithm prototype
  (`website/src/lib/ranking/`), each marked `JUDGMENT CALL` in the source. Most-important-first:
  1. ~~Cold-start episodes get permanently folded into the comparative comparison pool the first
     time a show crosses the cold-start threshold~~ (`engine.ts`, `addComparativeEpisode`) —
     **confirmed 2026-07-15 by Kayvan**: yes, fold them in immediately, as built. This resolves
     `AppSpec.md`'s open "do cold-start-only episodes ever join the comparison pool?" question in
     the affirmative — update that doc's Open Design Questions accordingly next session.
  2. Cold-start bucket ordering (`coldStart.ts`): liked > neutral > disliked; most-recent-first
     within a bucket. Arbitrary, undiscussed.
  3. Common-reference-episode selection when several candidates exist (`comparativePlacement.ts`,
     `findCommonReference`): picks the partner closest to the tied-against episode in current rank
     position. This is the actual answer to the open Bucket-3 item above — needs confirmation, not
     just awareness.
  4. Tie-break recursion mechanics: the new subject-vs-common-reference result stands in directly
     for the neutral subject-vs-B result to keep narrowing the same binary-search bounds, rather than
     treating the common reference's own rank position as a separate bound.
  5. Recursion cap: after 3 all-neutral tie-break attempts, falls back to inserting adjacent to the
     last-compared episode.
  6. No-history fallback: if the tied-against episode has no comparison history yet, skip tie-break
     entirely and insert adjacent to it.
  7. "Adjacent" direction in both fallbacks above means immediately *after* (worse than) the
     reference episode — arbitrary, could equally be "before."
- 2026-07-15: Picked the specific backend/hosting vendors — **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth) and
  **Vercel** (website hosting) — when Kayvan asked for a website-first, shared-account architecture
  and said "let me pick" on tech stack specifics. This is a real third-party dependency (accounts,
  data, hosting) chosen unilaterally rather than independently vetted, even though it was within the
  scope of what was asked. Worth a second look next session, especially the choice to trust Supabase
  with auth/account security rather than building that in-house — see `TechArchitecture.md`'s Why
  section and `Risks.md` for the reasoning.

## History

(Newest entries at the top. Prune detailed narrative to git-history pointers once a phase's
Deviations are fully cleared and reviewed — see `ProcessAndRoles.md`'s documented convention. This
keeps this file fast to read at the start of every session instead of growing forever.)

- 2026-07-15: Major architecture pivot: **website first, then iOS**, sharing one account system.
  Kayvan wants a website built first (not thrown away afterward) so the ranking algorithm and score
  formula can be tuned through fast iteration and real usage before committing to native iOS work.
  Rankings are tied to an email/password account (Supabase Auth), shared between the website and the
  future iOS app via a shared Supabase Postgres backend — this replaces the earlier "fully on-device,
  no backend" decision entirely. Stack: Next.js + Vercel for the website, Supabase for
  accounts/database, a Next.js API route proxying TMDB for both clients; SwiftUI + `supabase-swift`
  for the iOS app later. `DevelopmentPlan.md`'s phases renumbered/restructured: Phases 0-3 are now
  website (de-risk → vertical slice → feature completeness → polish), Phases 4-5 are iOS (build →
  polish/launch prep), Phase 6 is post-launch. Updated `TechArchitecture.md`, `AppSpec.md` (accounts
  core flow, per-user data model), `Risks.md` (vendor/auth/algorithm-drift risks), `CLAUDE.md`, and
  `ProcessAndRoles.md`. See Deviations above — the specific vendor choice (Supabase/Vercel) is
  flagged for a second look.
- 2026-07-15: Third follow-up round: worked out the score-from-position formula's direction
  together — **linear**, **per-show only** (a show's best episode is always a 10 regardless of the
  show's overall quality), **scores shift on every insertion** (so 1-10 is derived from current rank
  position + episode count, not stored as source of truth — see `AppSpec.md` data model), and
  **compresses for small sample sizes**, reaching the full 1-10 spread around 8 ranked episodes.
  Recorded a concrete v1 formula in `DevelopmentPlan.md`'s Discussion section as a tunable starting
  point — Kayvan explicitly expects this to need real tuning once there's an app to test it in, so
  it's not being treated as settled. Remaining open item narrowed to just the tie-break
  common-episode selection mechanics (Bucket 3 above).
- 2026-07-15: Second follow-up round: confirmed **3 cold-start buckets** (liked/disliked/neutral,
  matching Beli, not the original binary liked/disliked); designed the **tie-break mechanic** — a
  "neutral" comparison result triggers a follow-up comparison against a common reference episode
  (one the tied-against episode has already been compared to) rather than leaving the tie
  unresolved. `Docs/Roadmap.md` renamed to `Docs/DevelopmentPlan.md` and restructured into: The Idea,
  Ranking Algorithm (current design), Discussion (open questions to work out together), Development
  Phases (much more detailed than the old Phase Status table), and Issues. The score-from-position
  formula remains genuinely open — flagged for direct discussion, not something to decide
  unilaterally. All cross-references updated across `CLAUDE.md`, `AppSpec.md`, `ProcessAndRoles.md`,
  `Testing.md`.
- 2026-07-15: First follow-up round: closed out data-source and ranking-model questions — show/
  episode data source is **TMDB API**; ranking mechanic is modeled on **Beli**'s binary-insertion
  comparison approach; cold-start threshold is **~3-5 episodes**; visual design stays undecided
  until Phase 1.
- 2026-07-15: Initial bootstrap — PM-Claude operating docs created (`CLAUDE.md`, all of `Docs/`).
  No app code written yet.
