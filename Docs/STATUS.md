# Episode Ranker — Current Status

**Read this file first** — before the other docs, before doing anything else. It's the single
"what's actually going on right now" pointer, kept short and current on purpose.

Last updated: 2026-07-15 (later same day), **clean deliberate stop.** No agent is running.

## Punch List (ranked — read this section first for "what's actually next")

Every open item gets triaged into exactly one bucket the moment it surfaces, per
[ProcessAndRoles.md](ProcessAndRoles.md#punch-list-triage). Default is "log it, don't chase it"
unless it's small or genuinely blocking.

**Bucket 1 — Blocking / next in sequence:**
1. Phase 0: prototype the ranking algorithm (Beli-style binary-insertion comparison with
   common-episode tie-break, plus the v1 score-from-position formula — see `DevelopmentPlan.md`
   Phase 0) — this is the riskiest, least-proven part of the app and should be settled before any
   real UI work starts.

**Bucket 2 — Bugs/features needing hands-on verification or fixing:**
(empty for now)

**Bucket 3 — Design decisions needing human input (don't block code):**
1. Tie-break common-episode selection mechanics — which episode to pick when several candidates
   exist, what to do when none exist yet. See `DevelopmentPlan.md`'s Ranking Algorithm section.

**Bucket 4 — Backlog, logged, not being chased:**
1. iCloud/CloudKit sync across devices — app is on-device-only for now (see `TechArchitecture.md`);
   revisit if cross-device sync becomes wanted.

**Bucket 5 — Rework flagged for a later phase, not being worked now:**
(empty for now)

## Deviations Awaiting Review

Solo judgment calls made mid-session that weren't slept on get logged here and surfaced at the
start of the next session for a second look — even solo, "I decided this at 11pm without thinking
it through" is worth a deliberate re-check, not silent acceptance.

(empty — nothing pending; the SwiftData/on-device deviation logged at initial bootstrap was reviewed
and resolved below now that data sourcing and the ranking model are confirmed)

## History

(Newest entries at the top. Prune detailed narrative to git-history pointers once a phase's
Deviations are fully cleared and reviewed — see `ProcessAndRoles.md`'s documented convention. This
keeps this file fast to read at the start of every session instead of growing forever.)

- 2026-07-15: Third follow-up round: worked out the score-from-position formula's direction
  together — **linear**, **per-show only** (a show's best episode is always a 10 regardless of the
  show's overall quality), **scores shift on every insertion** (so 1-10 is derived from current rank
  position + episode count, not stored as source of truth — see `AppSpec.md` data model), and
  **compresses for small sample sizes**, reaching the full 1-10 spread around 8 ranked episodes.
  Recorded a concrete v1 formula in `DevelopmentPlan.md`'s Discussion section as a tunable starting
  point — Kayvan explicitly expects this to need real tuning once there's an app to test it in, so
  it's not being treated as settled. Remaining open item narrowed to just the tie-break
  common-episode selection mechanics (Bucket 3 above).
- 2026-07-15: Second follow-up round: confirmed **3 cold-start buckets** (liked/disliked/neutral,
  matching Beli, not the original binary liked/disliked); designed the **tie-break mechanic** — a
  "neutral" comparison result triggers a follow-up comparison against a common reference episode
  (one the tied-against episode has already been compared to) rather than leaving the tie
  unresolved. `Docs/Roadmap.md` renamed to `Docs/DevelopmentPlan.md` and restructured into: The Idea,
  Ranking Algorithm (current design), Discussion (open questions to work out together), Development
  Phases (much more detailed than the old Phase Status table), and Issues. The score-from-position
  formula remains genuinely open — flagged for direct discussion, not something to decide
  unilaterally. All cross-references updated across `CLAUDE.md`, `AppSpec.md`, `ProcessAndRoles.md`,
  `Testing.md`.
- 2026-07-15: First follow-up round: closed out data-source and ranking-model questions — show/
  episode data source is **TMDB API**; ranking mechanic is modeled on **Beli**'s binary-insertion
  comparison approach; cold-start threshold is **~3-5 episodes**; visual design stays undecided
  until Phase 1.
- 2026-07-15: Initial bootstrap — PM-Claude operating docs created (`CLAUDE.md`, all of `Docs/`).
  No app code written yet.
